This workshop introduces the process of creating a package, where each step in that process is dependent on the previous step. If a learner gets behind, or one of the steps doesnâ€™t work for them, they may not be able to catch up with the rest of the class. To help ensure that all learners are able to work through the whole process, we provide solution files.
